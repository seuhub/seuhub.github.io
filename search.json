They enable enhanced flexibility and are a core part of Hugo’s functionality, offering reusable snippets for embedding media, custom components, or dynamic content. Below, we’ll explore what shortcodes are and highlight some popular examples.\nWhat are Hugo Shortcodes? Shortcodes in Hugo are like mini-templates that simplify embedding specialized content into a page. Hugo has built-in shortcodes, and users can create custom ones. For instance, to embed a YouTube video, instead of writing the full HTML, you can use a shortcode like {{/*\u003c youtube \"video-id\" \u003e */}}.\nCommon Built-in Shortcodes Here are a few popular Hugo shortcodes and how to use them:\nYouTube Embed:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c youtube 3qHkcs3kG44 \u003e}} Rendered output: This shortcode takes a YouTube video ID, simplifying the process of embedding videos on your page.\nFigure: Shortcode:\n{{/*\u003c figure src=\"/img/posts/img-0.jpg\" title=\"Sample Image\" \u003e*/}} Rendered output: Sample Image This allows you to easily add images with captions and titles, handling image display responsively.\nGist (GitHub Snippets):\nShortcode:\n{{/*\u003c gist spf13 7896402 \u003e */}} Rendered: This integrates GitHub Gists by taking the username and gist ID, perfect for adding code snippets from GitHub.\nTwitter url:\nhttps://twitter.com/binovarghese_/status/1758148486510317907 Shortcode:\n{{\u003c twitter user=\"binovarghese_\" id=\"1758148486510317907\" \u003e}} Rendered: {{\u003c twitter user=“binovarghese_” id=“1758148486510317907” \u003e}}\nBenefits of Shortcodes Using shortcodes in Hugo streamlines content creation and ensures consistency across pages, saving time on repeated elements and complex HTML structures. With custom shortcodes, you can build rich, interactive content while keeping Markdown files clean and easy to manage.\nFor more details, check out Hugo’s official shortcode documentation.\n","description":"Hugo shortcodes are powerful tools for adding custom HTML or other special content within Markdown files without complex code...","tags":["shortcodes"],"title":"Understanding Hugo Shortcodes","uri":"/post/2020/understanding-hugo-shortcodes/"},{"content":"To create your own shortcodes in Hugo, add an HTML file in layouts/shortcodes/.

Netlify is popular for its ease of use, free hosting tier, and powerful features like automated builds, custom domain support, and built-in SSL. With Hugo’s efficient static site generation, deploying on Netlify enables fast, seamless updates and management.\nStep 1: Set Up netlify.toml Configuration The netlify.toml file is essential for configuring build settings in Netlify. Here’s a setup tailored for various deployment environments, including production, deploy previews, and branch deploys.\nAdd the following netlify.toml file to your Hugo project’s root directory:\n[build] publish = \"public\" command = \"hugo --gc --minify\" [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" HUGO_ENV = \"production\" HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"false\" [context.split1] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --enableGitInfo\" [context.split1.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" HUGO_ENV = \"production\" [context.deploy-preview] command = \"hugo --gc --minify --buildFuture -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" [context.branch-deploy] command = \"hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL\" [context.branch-deploy.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \"0.134.0\" [context.next.environment] HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = \"false\" Explanation of Key Parameters Build Command: hugo --gc --minify triggers garbage collection (--gc) and minifies output. HUGO_VERSION: Specifies the Hugo version to avoid compatibility issues. HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO: Used for tracking commit metadata in production. Deployment Contexts: Production: Builds optimized, production-ready files. Deploy Preview: Builds the site using the pull request URL, helpful for staging. Branch Deploy: Enables previews for branches other than the main one. Step 2: Connect Your Repository to Netlify Log In to Netlify: Go to Netlify.\nCreate a New Site: Choose “New site from Git” from the dashboard.\nSelect Your Repository: Choose GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, authenticate, and select your Hugo site repository.\nConfigure Build Settings:\nBuild Command: Leave as hugo. Publish Directory: Set as public (Netlify automatically reads from netlify.toml if it’s present). Deploy Your Site: Click “Deploy site” to initiate the first build. Netlify will pull from your repository, build, and deploy the site, which you can access via the provided default Netlify URL (e.g., https://example-site.netlify.app).\nStep 3: Preview and Customize Your Site Once the build completes, visit the live preview URL to verify that your site is working correctly.\nStep 4: Set Up a Custom Domain (Optional) To configure a custom domain:\nGo to the Netlify dashboard, select “Domain settings,” and add your domain. Follow the provided DNS setup instructions. If you want Netlify to manage DNS, you can transfer the domain or add a Netlify DNS record. Netlify automatically provisions an SSL certificate through Let’s Encrypt, adding secure HTTPS to your site. Step 5: Enable Continuous Deployment Netlify supports continuous deployment by default. Each push to your repository triggers a new build and redeploys the latest changes. This makes it easy to manage updates or collaborate with others on site changes.\nConclusion Deploying a Hugo site on Netlify offers a streamlined experience, leveraging Hugo’s fast builds with Netlify’s advanced hosting features. With a few simple steps, your site is live, secure, and ready for easy content updates directly from Git.\nThis setup is ideal for efficient deployment with customized environments, making it easy to manage development and production versions and maintain a polished, dynamic website.\n","description":"Hosting a Hugo site on Netlify is an effective solution for deploying static websites, combining Hugo’s speed with Netlify’s robust features..","tags":["hugo","Netlify"],"title":"Hosting Your Hugo Site on Netlify","uri":"/post/2020/netlify-configuration/"},{"content":"Note-taking helps structure information logically, making complex topics easier to break down, review, and connect — especially useful for studying, writing, or planning.\n","description":"Note the lorum ipsum.","tags":["ideas","notes"],"title":"Supports better organization of ideas","uri":"/notes/note1/"},{"content":"What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting language used for creating styled text through simple, readable syntax. Developed by John Gruber in 2004, its goal is to allow writers to format documents without complex code, making it easy to read and edit. The beauty of Markdown lies in its simplicity, allowing creators to add headings, lists, images, links, and more by typing a few symbols around their text.\nFor instance:\nTyping **bold text** makes text bold. Writing # at the beginning of a line turns it into a heading, and more # symbols make it a smaller subheading. Lists can be created using - or * for bullets or numbers for ordered lists. Because Markdown converts text to HTML, it’s perfect for web content creation, blog posts, documentation, and technical writing, all while remaining easy to format in a non-HTML context. Markdown files, saved as .md or .markdown files, are compatible with many popular platforms like GitHub, Reddit, and Hugo, making it a preferred choice for developers, writers, and content creators.\nUsing Markdown allows for better productivity and collaboration because anyone can edit or view Markdown text without needing HTML or specialized knowledge. Its clean, minimalistic approach makes it accessible and effective for writing that needs to balance readability and formatting.\n","description":"Markdown is a lightweight, plain-text formatting language used for creating styled text through simple, readable syntax....","tags":["markdown"],"title":"What is Markdown ?","uri":"/post/2020/markdown/"},{"content":"Headings To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (h3), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header). Heading level 1 Heading level 2 Heading level 3 Heading level 4 Heading level 5 Heading level 6 Paragraphs To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.\nMarkdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.\nMarkdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz. Gruber wrote the first markdown-to-html converter in Perl, and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages.\nBold To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.\n**bold text**\nItalic To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.
